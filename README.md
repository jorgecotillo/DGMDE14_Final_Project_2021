# Acknowledgement
The landmark method uses the calculation covered in Soukupová and Čech’s paper in 2016 titled” Real-Time Eye Blink Detection Using Facial Landmarks” to calculate the eye aspect ratio at each frame captured by the Raspberry Pi camera 
The landmark method followed the same structure of code with Adrian Rosebrock’s blog named “Drowsiness detection with OpenCV” to detect micro-sleeps
